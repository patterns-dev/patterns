<p>Summary 1:  Wherever there is action in a place, the spots which are the most inviting, are those high enough to give people a vantage point, and low enough to put them in action.</p>
<p>Summary 2: In any public place where people loiter, add a few steps at the edge where stairs come down or where there is a change of level.</p>
<p>Summary 3: The bottom few steps of stairs, and the balusters and rails along stairs, are precisely the kinds of places which resolve these tendencies.</p>
<p>Summary 4: People sit on the edges of the lower steps, if they are wide enough and inviting, and they lean against the rails.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Stepped cafe terraces, steps surrounding public plazas, stepped porches, stepped statues and seats, are all examples.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Make the steps out of wood or tile or brick so that they wear with time, and show the marks of feet, and are soft to the touch for people sitting on them - SOFT TILE AND BRICK ; and make the steps connect directly to surrounding buildings - CONNECTION TO THE EARTH .....</p>
