<p>Summary 1:  The instinct to climb up to some high place, from which you can look down and survey your world, seems to be a fundamental human instinct.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Build occasional high places as landmarks throughout the city.</p>
<p>Summary 3: High places are equally important, too, as places from which to look down: places that give a spectacular, comprehensive view of the town.</p>
<p>Summary 4: As for distribution, we suggest about one of these high places for each community of 7000, high enough to be seen throughout the community.</p>
<p>Summary 5: If high places are less frequent, they tend to be too special, and they have less power as landmarks.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Elaborate the area around the base of the high place -it is a natural position for a SMALL PUBLIC SQUARE; give the stair which leads up to the top, openings with views out, so that people can stop on the stair, sit down, look out, and be seen while they are climbing - STAIR SEATS, ZEN VIEW, OPEN STAIRS .....</p>
