<p>Summary 1:  Make the traveler&#039;s inn a place where travelers can take rooms for the night, but where - unlike most hotels and motels - the inn draws all its energy from the community of travelers that are there any given evening.</p>
<p>Summary 2: At all times, except our own, the inn was a wonderful place, where strangers met for a night, to eat, and drink, play cards, tell stories, and experience extraordinary adventures.</p>
<p>Summary 3: The most extreme version is the Indian pilgrim&apos;s inn, or the Persian caravanserai.</p>
<p>Summary 4: There is a courtyard where the people meet, and a place to one side of the courtyard where they eat, and also on this side there is the person who looks after the Inn, and on the other three sides of the courtyard there are the rooms - in front of the rooms is an arcade, maybe one step up from the courtyard, and about ten feet deep, with another step leading into the rooms.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The atmosphere comes mainly from the fact that the people who run the place themselves live there and treat the entire inn as their household.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Provide the opportunity for communal eating, not a restaurant, but common food around a common table - COMMUNAL EATING; and, over and above the individual rooms there are at least some areas where people can lie down and sleep in public unafraid - SLEEPING IN PUBLIC, COMMUNAL SLEEPING..</p>
