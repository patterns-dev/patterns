<p>Summary 1:  All kinds of work, office work and industrial work and agricultural work, are radically decentralized by SCATTERED WORK, and INDUSTRIAL RIBBONS and grouped in small communities - WORK COMMUNITY.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Where the work is complicated and requires larger organizations, several of these work groups can federate and cooperate to produce complex artifacts and services.</p>
<p>Summary 3: He can only understand the whole and be responsible for the whole when the work which happens in society, all of it, is undertaken by small self-governing human groups; groups small enough to give people understanding through face-to-face contact, and autonomous enough to let the workers themselves govern their own affairs.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Equally, to strive for leisure as an alternative to work would be considered a complete misunderstanding of one of the basic truths of human existence, namely, that work and leisure are complementary parts of the same living process and cannot be separated without destroying the joy of work and the bliss of leisure.</p>
<p>Summary 5: &quot;If the nature of the work is properly appreciated and applied, it will stand in the same relation to the higher faculties as food is to the physical body.</p>
<p>Summary 6: It nourishes and enlivens the higher man and urges him to produce the best he is capable of.</p>
