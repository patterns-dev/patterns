<p>Summary 1:  Within the general scheme of outdoor spaces, made positive according to the patterns POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE and HIERARCHY OF OPEN SPACE, it is necessary to pay special attention to those smallest ones, less than 30 or 40 feet across the courtyards - because it is especially easy to make them in such a way that they do not live.</p>
<p>Summary 2: The courtyards built in modern buildings are very often dead.</p>
<p>Summary 3: They are intended to be private open spaces for people to use - but they end up unused, full of gravel and abstract sculptures.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Place every courtyard in such a way that there is a view out of it to some larger open space; place it so that at least two or three doors open from the building into it and so that the natural paths which connect these doors pass across the courtyard.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The courtyard should never be perfectly enclosed by the rooms which surround it, but should give at least a glimpse of some other space beyond.</p>
<p>Summary 6: The photographs do not tell the whole story but still, you can see that the courtyards look out, along paths, through the buildings, to larger spaces.</p>
