<p>Summary 5: Since the industrial revolution, there has been a growing tendency for people to rely on impersonal producers for their vegetables; however, in a world where vegetables are central and where self-sufficiency increases, it becomes as natural for families to have their own vegetables as their own air.</p>
<p>Summary 6: The amount of land it takes to grow the vegetables for a household is surprisingly small..</p>
