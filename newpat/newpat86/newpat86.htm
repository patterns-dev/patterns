<p>Summary 1: In every neighborhood, build a children&apos;s home - a second home for children - a large rambling house or workplace - a place where children can stay for an hour or two, or for a week.</p>
<p>Summary 2: When we look at the children&apos;s needs, and at the needs of the adults, we realize that what is needed is a new institution in the neighborhood: a children&apos;s home - a place where children can be safe and well looked after, night and day, with the full range of opportunities and social activities that can introduce them, fully, to society.</p>
<p>Summary 3: 141-42).</p>
<p>Summary 4: The children&apos;s home we propose is a place which &quot;De-intensifies the parent-child relationship&quot; by bringing the child into authentic social relationships with several other adults and many other children.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Silverstein has indicated that the child&apos;s sense of his first school being &quot;Separate&quot; from society can be reduced if the play areas of the children&apos;s home are open to all passing adults and to all passing children.</p>
<p>Summary 6: The children&apos;s home pattern has been tried, successfully, in a far more extreme form than we imagine here, in many kibbutzim where children are raised in collective nurseries, and merely visit their parents for a few hours per week.</p>
