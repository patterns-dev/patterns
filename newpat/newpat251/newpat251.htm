<p>Summary 1:  Choose a variety of different chairs, some big, some small, some softer than others, some rockers, some very old, some new, with arms, without arms, some wicker, some wood, some cloth.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Designers have for years been creating &quot;Perfect chairs&quot; - chairs that can be manufactured cheaply in mass.</p>
<p>Summary 3: If the chairs are all the same, these differences are repressed, and some people are uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Summary 4: What is less obvious, and yet perhaps most important of all, is this: we project our moods and personalities into the chairs we sit in.</p>
<p>Summary 5: In one mood a big fat chair is just right; in another mood, a rocking chair; for another, a stiff upright; and yet again, a stool or sofa.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Where chairs are placed alone and where chairs are gathered, reinforce the character of the places which the chairs create with POOLS OF LIGHT, each local to the group of chairs it marks.....</p>
