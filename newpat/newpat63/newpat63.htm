<p>Summary 1:  To make these places alive at night, there is nothing like music and dancing; this pattern simply states the physical conditions which will encourage dancing and music to fill the streets.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Along promenades, in squares and evening centers, make a slightly raised platform to form a bandstand, where street musicians and local bands can play.</p>
<p>Summary 3: All over the earth, people once danced in the streets; in theater, song, and natural speech, &quot;Dancing in the street&quot; is an image of supreme joy.</p>
<p>Summary 4: There are the Balinese dancers who fall into a trance whirling around in the street; the mariachi bands in Mexico - every town has several squares where the bands play and the neighborhood comes out to dance; there is the European and American tradition of bandstands and jubilees in the park; there is the bon odori festival in Japan, when everybody claps and dances in the streets.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Communities are fragmented; people are uncomfortable in the streets, afraid with one another; not many people play the right kind of music; people are embarrassed.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Place the bandstand in a pocket of activity, toward the edge of a square or a promenade - ACTIVITY POCKETS; make it a room, defined by trellises and columns - PUBLIC OUTDOOR ROOM; build FOOD STANDS around the bandstand; and for dancing, maybe colored canvas canopies, which reach out over portions of the street, and make the street, or parts of it, into a great, half-open ten t- CANVAS ROOFS.....</p>
