<p>Summary 1:  Choose surface colors which, together with the color of the natural light, reflected light, and artificial lights, create a warm light in the rooms.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Now, the color of the light in a space does not depend in any simple way on the color of the surface.</p>
<p>Summary 3: The light in a hospital corridor, lit by fluorescent tubes, bouncing off green walls is cold light - in the green-blue range.</p>
<p>Summary 4: In a room with lots of natural light, the overall light is warm.</p>
<p>Summary 5: In order to make a room comfortable, you must use a collection of colors which together with the sources of light and the reflecting surfaces outside the room, combine to make the reflected light which exists in the middle of the room warm, that is, toward the yellow-red.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Finally, it is vital to remember that this pattern requires only that the light - the total light in the middle of a room, coming from sunlight, artificial lights, reflections from walls, reflections from outside, from carpets - the total light, lies in that part of the color triangle we call &quot;Warm.&quot; It does not require that any individual color surfaces in the room should be red or orange or yellow - only that the combined effect of all the surfaces and lights together, creates light in the middle of the room which lies in the warm part of the color triangle..</p>
