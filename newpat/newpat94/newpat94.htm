<p>Summary 1:  In a society which nurtures people and fosters trust, the fact that people sometimes want to sleep in public is the most natural thing in the world.</p>
<p>Summary 2: If he has no place to go - then, we, the people of the town, can be happy that he can at least sleep on the public paths and benches; and, of course, it may also be someone who does have a place to go, but happens to like napping in the street.</p>
<p>Summary 3: In our society, sleeping in public, like loitering, is thought of as an act for criminals and destitutes.</p>
<p>Summary 4: In our world, when homeless people start sleeping on public benches or in public buildings, upright citizens get nervous, and the police soon restore &quot;Public order&quot;.</p>
<p>Summary 5: In an environment where there are very few places to lie down and sleep people who sleep in public seem unnatural, because it is so rare.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Above all, put the places for sleeping along BUILDING EDGES ; make seats there, and perhaps even a bed alcove or two in public might be a nice touch - BED ALCOVE, SEAT SPOTS; but above all, it will hinge on the attitudes which people have - do anything you can to create trust, so that people feel no fear in going to sleep in public and so that other people feel no fear of people sleeping in the street..</p>
