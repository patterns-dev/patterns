<p>Summary 1:  People cannot be genuinely comfortable and healthy in a house which is not theirs.</p>
<p>Summary 2: In the imperishable primal language of the human heart house means my house, your house, a man&#039;s own house.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Therefore his deeper wish is that it be his own house, that he not have to share with anyone other than his own family.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Just as speculation and the profit motive make it impossible for people to adapt their houses to their own needs, so tenancy, rental, and landlords do the same.</p>
<p>Summary 5: People will only be able to feel comfortable in their houses, if they can change their houses to suit themselves, add on whatever they need, rearrange the garden as they like it; and, of course, they can only do this in circumstances where they are the legal owners of the house and land; and if, in high density multi-story housing, each apartment, like a house, has a welldefined volume, in which the owner can make changes as he likes.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Even modified forms of rental can help the situation if they allow people to change their houses according to their needs and give people some financial stake in the process of maintenance..</p>
