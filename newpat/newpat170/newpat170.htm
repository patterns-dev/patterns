<p>Summary 1:  In the climates where fruit trees grow, the orchards give the land an almost magical identity: think of the orange groves of Southern California, the cherry trees of Japan, the olive trees of Greece.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Plant small orchards of fruit trees in gardens and on common land along paths and streets, in parks, in neighborhoods: wherever there are well-established groups that can themselves care for the trees and harvest the fruit.</p>
<p>Summary 3: The presence of orchards adds an experience that has all but vanished from cities - the experience of growth, harvest, local sources of fresh food; walking down a city street, pulling an apple out of a tree, and biting into it.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Fruit trees on common land add much more to the neighborhood and the community than the same trees in private backyards: privately grown, the trees tend to produce more fruit than one household can consume.</p>
<p>Summary 5: On public land, the trees concentrate the feeling of mutual benefit and responsibility.</p>
<p>Summary 6: If you have an especially nice fruit tree, make a TREE PLACE under it, with a GARDEN SEAT, or arrange a path so the tree can provide a natural goal along the path - PATHS AND GOALS.....</p>
