<p>Summary 1:  If major roads are in position - PARALLEL ROADS, and you are in the process of defining the local roads, this pattern gives the nature of the intersections.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Traffic accidents are far more frequent where two roads cross than at T junctions.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Lay out the road system so that any two roads which meet at grade, meet in three-way T junctions as near 90 degrees as possible.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Where two two-way roads cross, there are 16 major collision points, compared with three for a T junction.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Further evidence shows that the T junction is safest if it is a right-angled junction.</p>
<p>Summary 6: At busy junctions, where pedestrian paths converge, make a special raised crossing for pedestrians, something more than the usual crosswalk - ROAD CROSSING.....</p>
