<p>Summary 1:  To help create these larger patterns, it is necessary to build row houses instead.</p>
<p>Summary 2: At densities of 15 to 30 houses per acre, row houses are essential.</p>
<p>Summary 3: For row houses, place houses along pedestrian paths that run at right angles to local roads and parking lots, and give each house a long frontage and a shallow depth.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Above 15 houses per acre, it is almost impossible to make houses freestanding without destroying the open space around them; the open space which is left gets reduced to nothing more than shallow rings around the houses.</p>
<p>Summary 5: These four problems of row houses can easily be solved by making the houses long and thin, along the paths, like cottages.</p>
<p>Summary 6: So the house can take on a variety of shapes, with a guarantee of a reasonable amount of privacy for its garden and for most of the house, an increase in the amount of light into the house, and an increase in the amount of indoor space that can be next to outdoor areas.</p>
