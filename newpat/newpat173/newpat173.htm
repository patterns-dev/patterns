<p>Summary 1:  In private houses, both the HALF-HIDDEN GARDEN and the PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET require walls.</p>
<p>Summary 2: More generally, not only private gardens, but public gardens too, and even small parks and greens - QUIET BACKS, ACCESSIBLE GREEN, need some kind of enclosure round them, to make them as beautiful and quiet as possible.</p>
<p>Summary 3: In a very small garden, form the enclosure with buildings or walls; even hedges and fences will not be enough to keep out sound.</p>
<p>Summary 4: We are not convinced that it applies to all small parks - but it is hard to differentiate precisely between the places where a walled garden is desirable and the places where it is not.</p>
<p>Summary 5: There are far more parks and gardens left open, that need to be walled, than vice versa, so we emphasize the walled condition.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Use the garden wall to help form positive outdoor space - POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE; but pierce it with balustrades and windows to make connections between garden and street, or garden and garden - PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET, TRELLISED WALK, HALF-OPEN WALL, and above all, give it openings to make views into other larger and more distant spaces - HIERARCHY OF OPEN SPACE, ZEN VIEW .....</p>
