<p>Summary 2: Illich describes a style of learning that is quite the opposite from schools.</p>
<p>Summary 3: The alternative to social control through the schools is the voluntary participation in society through networks which provide access to all its resources for learning.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Schools are designed on the assumption that there is a secret to everything in life; that the quality of life depends on knowing that secret; that secrets can be known only in orderly successions; and that only teachers can properly reveal these secrets.</p>
<p>Summary 5: In addition to the tentative conclusions of the Carnegie Commission reports, the last year has brought forth a series of important documents which show that responsible people are becoming aware of the fact that schooling for certification cannot continue to be counted upon as the central educational device of a modern society.</p>
<p>Summary 6: The president of Peru has accepted the recommendation of his commission on education, which proposes to abolish free schools in favor of free educational opportunities provided throughout life..</p>
