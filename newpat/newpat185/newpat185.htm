<p>Summary 1:  According to the SEQUENCE OF SITTING SPACES, there will be a variety of different kinds of sitting space throughout an office building or a house or workshop - some formal, some informal, some large, some small, laid out in part according to the INTIMACY GRADIENT.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Place each sitting space in a position which is protected, not cut by paths or movement, roughly circular, made so that the room itself helps to suggest the circle - not too strongly - with paths and activities around it, so that people naturally gravitate toward the chairs when they get into the mood to sit.</p>
<p>Summary 3: A sitting circle needs essentially the same position as a COMMON AREA AT THE HEART, but in miniature: a well defined area, with paths running past it, not cutting through it, and placed so that people naturally pass by it, stop and talk, lean on the backs of chairs, gradually sit down, move position, get up again.</p>
<p>Summary 4: When people sit down to talk together they try to arrange themselves roughly in a circle.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Relatively loose arrangements, where there are many different sofas, cushions, and chairs, all free to move, work to bring a sitting circle to life.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Use a fire, and columns, and half-open walls to form the shape of the circle - THE FIRE, THE SHAPE OF INDOOR SPACE, HALF-OPEN WALL; but do not make it too formal or too enclosed - COMMON AREAS AT THE HEART, SEQUENCE OF SITTING SPACES..</p>
