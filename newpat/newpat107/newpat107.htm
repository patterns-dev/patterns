<p>Summary 1:  Modern buildings are often shaped with no concern for natural light - they depend almost entirely on artificial light.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Arrange each building so that it breaks down into wings which correspond, approximately, to the most important natural social groups within the building.</p>
<p>Summary 3: If we treat the presence of natural light as an essential - not optional - feature of indoor space, then no building could ever be more than 20-25 feet deep, since no point in a building which is more.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Unless the building is first conceived as being made of long, thin wings, there is no possible way of introducing LIGHT ON TWO SIDES, in its complete form, later in the process.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Using the ratio of built floor area to total site area as a measure of density and the semi-depth of the building as a measure of daylight conditions, they have compared three different arrangements of building and open space, which they call S,, S,, and S2.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Three building types.</p>
