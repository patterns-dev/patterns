<p>Summary 1:  Where the edge of a window or the overhanging eave of a roof is silhouetted against the sky, make a rich, detailed taspestry of light and dark, to break up the light and soften it.</p>
<p>Summary 2: For all these reasons, we have a natural desire to diffuse light with lamp shades or indirect lighting, so that the images created by the light will be &quot;Softer,&quot; that is, that the boundaries perceived are not sharp, there is less contrast, fewer shadows, and the details are easier to see.</p>
<p>Summary 3: When there is bright light coming in through the window, it creates glare against the darkness of the wall around the window -see DEEP REVEALS.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Filtering the light especially at the edges of the window cuts down the glare by letting in less light.</p>
<p>Summary 5: To create filtered light, partially cover those windows which get direct sunlight, with vines and lattices.</p>
<p>Summary 6: The edge of the window can have fine tracery - that is, the edge of the glass itself, not the frame, so that the light coming in is gradually stronger from the edge to the center of the window; the tracery is best toward the top of the window where the light is strongest..</p>
