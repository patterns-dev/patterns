<p>Summary 1:  Within the FARMHOUSE KITCHEN, or any other kind of kitchen, it is essential that the cooking area be fashioned as a workshop for the preparation of food, and not as some kind of magazine kitchen with built-in counters and decorator colors.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Cooking is uncomfortable if the kitchen counter is too short and also if it is too long.</p>
<p>Summary 3: There is no need for the counter to be continuous or entirely &quot;Built-in&quot; as it is in many modem kitchens - it can even consist of free-standing tables or counter tops.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Empirical support for the notion that there is insufficient counter space in many kitchens comes from a recent work by the Small Homes Council, University of Illinois.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The Council found that in over a hundred housing developments, 67 per cent had too little counter space.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Place the most important part of the working surface in the sunlight - SUNNY COUNTER; put all the kitchen tools and plates and saucepans and nonperishable food around the walls, one deep, so all of it is visible, and all of it directly open to reach - THICK WALLS, OPEN SHELVES.....</p>
