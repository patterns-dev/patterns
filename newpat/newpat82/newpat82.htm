<p>Summary 1:  To establish distances between departments, calculate the number of trips per day made between each two departments; get the &quot;Nuisance distance&quot; from the graph above; then make sure that the physical distance between the two departments is less than the nuisance distance.</p>
<p>Summary 2: The nuisance distance for any trip frequency is the distance at which we predict that at least 50 per cent of all people will begin to consider this distance a nuisance.</p>
<p>Summary 3: How do stairs enter in? What part does vertical distance play in the experience of proximity? Or, to put it more precisely, what is the horizontal equivalent of one flight of stairs? Suppose two departments need to be within 100 feet of one another, according to the proximity graph - and suppose that they are for some reason on different stories, one floor apart.</p>
<p>Summary 4: People knew 12.2 per cent of the people from other departments on the same floor as their own, 8.9 per cent of the people from other departments one floor apart from their own floor, and only 2.2 per cent of the people from other departments two floors apart from their own.</p>
<p>Summary 5: On the basis of this, evidence, we conjecture that one stair is equal to about 100 horizontal feet in its effect on interaction and feelings of distance; and that two flights of stairs are equal to about 300 horizontal feet.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Give every working group on upper storys its own stair to connect it directly to the public world - PEDESTRIAN STREET, OPEN STAIRS; if there are internal corridors between groups, make them large enough to function as streets - BUILDING THOROUGHFARE; and identify each workgroup clearly, and give it a well-marked entrance, so that people easily find their way from one to another - FAMILY OF ENTRANCES.....</p>
