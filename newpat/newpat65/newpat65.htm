<p>Summary 1: As far as birth is concerned, each group of neighborhoods must be able to take care of the birth process, in local, human terms.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Build local birth places where women go to have their children: places that are specially tailored to childbirth as a natural, eventful moment - where the entire family comes for prenatal care and education; where fathers and midwives help during the hours of labor and birth.</p>
<p>Summary 3: &quot;Pregnancy is no state of emergency from which the mother may hopefully be returned to &#039;normality&#039; after the birth of the child....</p>
<p>Summary 4: It is a highly active, potent, developmental process of the family going forward to its natural culmination in delivery.</p>
<p>Summary 5: We quote now from Judith Shaw&#039;s description of a good birth place.</p>
<p>Summary 6: The birthing place should have accommodations for the entire family.</p>
