<p>Summary 1:  Two earlier patterns can be helped by climbing plants around the building: TRELLISED WALK and FILTERED LIGHT.</p>
<p>Summary 2: A building finally becomes a part of its surroundings when the plants grow over parts of it as freely as they grow along the ground.</p>
<p>Summary 3: On sunny walls, train climbing plants to grow up round the openings in the wall-the windows, doors, porches, arcades, and trellises.</p>
<p>Summary 4: One argument, consistent with others in the book, is that climbing plants effect a smooth transition between the built and the natural.</p>
<p>Summary 5: When the plants grow around the openings of buildings, they create a special kind of filtered light inside.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Perhaps most important, the texture of climbing plants is ever different; it is subtly different from day to day, as the wind and sun play upon it; and it is greatly different from season to season..</p>
