<p>Summary 1:  A loop is defined as any stretch of road which makes it impossible for cars that don&#039;t have destinations on it to use it as a shortcut.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Do not allow any one loop to serve more than 50 cars, and keep the road really narrow - 17 to 20 feet is quite enough.</p>
<p>Summary 3: &quot; We define a looped road as any road in a road network so placed that no path along other roads in the road network can be shortened by travel along the &quot;loop.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The loops themselves must be designed to discourage high volumes or high speeds: this depends on the total number of houses served by the loop, the road surface, the road width, and the number of curves and corners.</p>
<p>Summary 5: A way of closing streets to form looped local roads.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Make all the junctions between local roads three-way T junctions, never four-way intersections - T JUNCTIONS; wherever there is any possibility of life from buildings being oriented toward the road, give the road a very rough surface of grass and gravel, with paving stones for wheels of cars - GREEN STREETS; keep parking off the road in driveways - SMALL PARKING LOTS and CAR CONNECTION; except where the roads are very quiet, run pedestrian paths at right angles to them, not along them, and make buildings open off these paths, not off the roads - NETWORK OF PATHS AND CARS.....</p>
