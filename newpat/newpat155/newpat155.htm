<p>Summary 1:  We have explained, in OLD PEOPLE EVERYWHERE, that it is essential to have a balanced number of old people in every neighborhood, partly centered around a communal place, but largely strung out among the other houses of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Like ROOMS TO RENT and TEENAGER&#039;S COTTAGE, this cottage can be rented out or used for other purposes in time of trouble.</p>
<p>Summary 3: In all cases, place these cottages at ground level, right on the street, where people are walking by, and close to neighborhood services and common land.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The conflict can be partly resolved, if each house which houses a nuclear family has, somewhere near it, a small cottage where a grandparent can live, far enough away to be independent, and yet close enough to feel some tie and to be cared for in a time of trouble or approaching death.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Many of the old people in our society are forced to live in miserable tiny rooms, way in the back of some run-down old folks hotel.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Perhaps the most important part of an old age cottage is the front porch and front door bench outside the door, right on the street - PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET, FRONT DOOR BENCH; for the rest, arrange the cottage pretty much according to the layout of any HOUSE FOR ONE PERSON; make provisions for SETTLED WORK; and give the cottage a STREET WINDOW..</p>
