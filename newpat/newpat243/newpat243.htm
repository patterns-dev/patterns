<p>Summary 1:  If you have also marked the places where it makes sense to build seats - SEAT SPOTS, FRONT DOOR BENCH - you can kill two birds with one stone by using the walls as seats which help enclose the outdoor space wherever its positive character is weakest.</p>
<p>Summary 2: In many places walls and fences between outdoor spaces are too high; but no boundary at all does injustice to the subtlety of the divisions between the spaces.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Surround any natural outdoor area, and make minor boundaries between outdoor areas with low walls, about 16 inches high, and wide enough to sit on, at least 12 inches wide.</p>
<p>Summary 4: If there is a high wall or a hedge, then the people in the garden have no way of being connected to the street; the people in the street have no way of being connected to the garden.</p>
<p>Summary 5: A low wall or balustrade, just at the right height for sitting, is perfect.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Examples: A low wall with the children&#039;s sandbox on one side, circulation path on the other; low wall at the front of the garden, connecting the house to the public path; a sitting wall that is a retaining wall, with plants on one side, where people can sit close to the flowers and eat their lunch..</p>
