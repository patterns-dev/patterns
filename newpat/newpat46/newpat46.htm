<p>Summary 1:  We have proposed that shops be widely decentralized and placed in such a way that they are most accessible to the communities which use them WEB OF SHOPPING.</p>
<p>Summary 2: The largest groups of shops are arranged to form pedestrian streets or SHOPPING STREETS which will almost always need a market to survive.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Is there a reasonable economic basis for a marketplace of many shops?.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Or are markets ruled out by the efficiencies of the supermarket? The major problem is one of coordination - coordination of individual shops to form one coherent market and coordination of many similar shops, from several markets, to make bulk purchase arrangements.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The Pike Place Market - a market of many shops in Seattle.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Make the aisles wide enough for small delivery carts and for a dense throng of pedestrians perhaps 6 to 12 feet wide BUlLDING THOROUGHFARE; keep the stalls extremely small so that the rent is low perhaps no more than six feet by nine feet shops which need more space can occupy two - INDIVIDUALLY OWNED SHOPS; define the stalls with columns at the corners only - COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS; perhaps even let the owners make roofs for themselves - CANVAS ROOFS; connect the aisles with the outside so that the market is a direct continuation of the pedestrian paths in the city just around it - PEDESTRIAN STREET.....</p>
