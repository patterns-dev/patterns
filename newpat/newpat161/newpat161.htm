<p>Summary 1:  The area immediately outside the building, to the south - that angle between its walls and the earth where the sun falls - must be developed and made into a place which lets people bask in it.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Develop this spot as a special sunny place - make it the important outdoor room, a place to work in the sun, or a place for a swing and some special plants, a place to sunbathe.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Be very careful indeed to place the sunny place in a position where it is sheltered from the wind.</p>
<p>Summary 4: We have observed that these places are more inviting if they are placed in the crook of a building or wall, where there is just enough enclosure from a hedge, a low wall, a column, to provide a backdrop, a place to sit up against and take in the sun.</p>
<p>Summary 5: A particularly beautiful version of this pattern can be made when several sunny places are placed together - perhaps for a HOUSE CLUSTER or a WORK COMMUNITY.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Make the place itself as much as possible like a room - PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET, OUTDOOR ROOM; always at least six feet deep, no less - SIX-FOOT BALCONY; perhaps with foliage or a canvas to filter the light on hot days - FILTERED LIGHT, TRELLISED WALK, CANVAS ROOF..</p>
