<p>Summary 1:  Gans&#039; data underscore our intuitions: people want to be part of a neighborly spatial cluster; contact between people sharing such a cluster is a vital function.</p>
<p>Summary 2: What about the size of the cluster? What is the appropriate size? In Gans&#039; investigations each home stands at the center of a cluster of five or six other homes.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Of course, the average size for clusters might be less, perhaps around 6 or 8; and clusters of 3, 4, or 5 homes can work perfectly well.</p>
<p>Summary 4: In a new neighborhood, with houses built on the ground, we imagine quite dramatic clusters, with the houses built around or to the side of common land; and with a core to the cluster that gradually tapers off at the edges.</p>
<p>Summary 5: We advocate a system of ownership where the deed to one home carries with it part ownership in the cluster to which the home belongs; and ideally, this in turn carries with it part owner ship in the neighborhood made up of several clusters.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Arrange paths clearly - CIRCULATION REALMS - and lay these paths out in such a way that they create busier paths and backwaters, even within the cluster - DEGREES OF PUBLICNESS; keep parking in SMALL PARKING LOTS, and make the houses in the cluster suit the households which will live there - THE FAMILY, HOUSE FOR A SMALL FAMILY, HOUSE FOR A COUPLE, HOUSE FOR ONE PERSON, YOUR OWN HOME.....</p>
