<p>Summary 1:  People are different, and the way they want to place their houses in a neighborhood is one of the most basic kinds of difference.</p>
<p>Summary 2: The inbetween houses may then be located on the paths half-way between the other two.</p>
<p>Summary 3: To make sure that the different kinds of people can find houses which satisfy their own particular desires, we suggest that each cluster of houses, and each neighborhood should have three kinds of houses, in about equal numbers: those which are nearest to the action, those which are half-way between, and those which are almost completely isolated.</p>
<p>Summary 4: When we were helping a group of people to design their own cluster of houses, we first asked each person to consider his preference for location on the basis of extrovert-introvert.</p>
<p>Summary 5: In one house cluster: private homes, public homes, and in-between.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Within a neighborhood, place higher density clusters along the busier streets- HOUSING HILL, ROW HOUSES, and lower density clusters along the backwaters HOUSE CLUSTER, ROW HOUSES..</p>
