<p>Summary 1:  Arrange the sleeping area so that there is the possibility for children and adults to sleep in the same space, in sight and sound of one another, at least as an occasional alternative to their more usual sleeping habits.</p>
<p>Summary 2: In Indian villages during the dry season the men pull their beds into the compound at sundown and talk and smoke together, then drift off to sleep.</p>
<p>Summary 3: People are uneasy about spending the night because it usually means having to make up a guest bed, or sleeping on the rug, or cramped on the sofa.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Think how much more inviting it would be if, at the end of the night, people simply dozed off, in ones and twos, in alcoves, and on mats with quilts, around the main sleeping area of the house, or around the commons.</p>
<p>Summary 5: There might be a place in the commons - not in any one person&#039;s private space - a place where late at night after people have been together for the evening and the fire is dying out, it is simple to draw together and sleep - a place where children and parents can sleep together on special nights.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Of course, the space for guest&#039;s beds must be made so that it is not dead when it is not used for sleeping..</p>
