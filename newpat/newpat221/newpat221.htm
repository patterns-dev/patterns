<p>Summary 1:  You know roughly where you want doors and windows from ZEN VIEW, STREET WINDOWS, WINDOW PLACE, WINDOWS OVERLOOKING LIFE, CORNER DOORS.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Make the windows smaller and smaller, as you go higher in the building.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Although there is no constraint on the exact dimension of the windows, there is a general rule of thumb, which will make window sizes vary: Windows, as a rule, should become smaller as you get higher up in the building.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The area of windows needed for light and ventilation depends on the size of rooms, and rooms are generally smaller on upper stories of the building - the communal rooms are generally on the ground floor and more private rooms upstairs.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The amount of daylight coming through a window depends on the area of open sky visible through the window.</p>
<p>Summary 6: The higher the window, the more open sky is visible - so less window area is needed to get sufficient daylight in..</p>
