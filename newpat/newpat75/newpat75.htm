<p>Summary 1:  Private realms for the groups and individuals that make up the extended family: couple&#039;s realms, private rooms, sub-households for small families.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Until a few years ago, human society was based on the extended family: a family of at least three generations, with parents, children, grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins, all living together in a single or loosely knit multiple household.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Each person in a nuclear family is too tightly linked to other members of the family; any one relationship which goes sour, even for a few hours, becomes critical; people cannot simply turn away toward uncles, aunts, grandchildren, cousins, brothers.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Since the old extended family, based on blood ties, seems to be gone - at least for the moment - this can only happen if small families, couples, and single people join together in voluntary &quot;Families&quot; of ten or so.</p>
<p>Summary 5: &quot;An entirely different kind of family.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Not exclusive, like your families, and not predestined, not compulsory.</p>
