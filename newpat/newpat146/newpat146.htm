<p>Summary 1:  Lay out the office space as wings of open space, with free standing columns around their edges, so they define half-private and common spaces opening into one another.</p>
<p>Summary 2: In either case, create a variety of space throughout the office - comparable in variety to the different sizes and kinds of space in a large old house.</p>
<p>Summary 3: The standard approaches to the problem of flexibility in office spaces are: uninterrupted modular space with modular partitions and entire floors of uninterrupted space with low ceilings and no partitions.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Though these spaces were designed to support family life, they turn out also to support the natural structure of work groups: there are small spaces for private and half-private offices, slightly larger spaces for work groups of two to six, usually one space where up to 12 people can gather, and a commons centered around the kitchen and dining room.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Far more often, the work groups which will occupy the space are unknown at the time the space is built.</p>
<p>Summary 6: The kind of space which will create this possibility is not &quot;Warehouse&quot; space or &quot;Office landscape&quot; space but instead, a kind of space which contains the possibility that people need, in the form of columns and ceiling height variety, to encourage them to modify it as they use it..</p>
