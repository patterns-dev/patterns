<p>Summary 1: Everybody loves window seats, bay windows, and big windows with low sills and comfortable chairs drawn up to them.</p>
<p>Summary 2: In every room where you spend any length of time during the day, make at least one window into a &quot;Window place&quot;.</p>
<p>Summary 3: All of the following can function as &quot;Places&quot; in this sense: bay windows, window seats, a low window sill where there is an obvious position for a comfortable armchair, and deep alcoves with windows all around them.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The most elaborate kind of window place: almost like a gazebo or a conservatory, windows all around it, a small room, almost part of the garden.</p>
<p>Summary 5: In principle, any window with a reasonably pleasant view can be a window place, provided that it is taken seriously as a space, a volume, not merely treated as a hole in the wall.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Window places should even be considered for waiting rooms or as special places along the length of hallways..</p>
