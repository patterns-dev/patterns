<p>Summary 1:  Anywhere where there are open shelves, and around any room which tends to accumulate potted plants, books, plates, bits of paper, boxes, beautiful vases, and little things you have picked up along your travels, there is a need for space where these things can lie undisturbed, without making the room a mess THICK WALLS, OPEN SHELVES.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Unless such things are immediately at hand, the flow of life is awkward, full of mistakes; things are forgotten, misplaced.</p>
<p>Summary 3: When there are surfaces here and there, around the rooms and passages and doors, which are at waist height, they become natural places to leave things and later pick them up.</p>
<p>Summary 4: When there are no such surfaces, then things either get put away and are then forgotten and lost, or they are in the way and must continually be cleared aside.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The things that tend to collect on waist high shelves become a natural, evolving kind of display of the most ordinary things - the things that are most immediately a part of one&#039;s life.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Since for each person these things will vary, the waist high shelf helps a room become unique and personal, effortlessly..</p>
