<p>Summary 1:  People&#039;s attitude to this pattern often runs along the following lines: &quot;The pattern suggests that I should sleep somewhere where the sun can wake me up; but I don&#039;t want the sun to wake me up; I want to be able to sleep late, whenever I can.</p>
<p>Summary 2: I guess I have a different style of life; so the pattern doesn&#039;t apply to me.</p>
<p>Summary 3: If we wake up immediately after a period of dreaming, we will feel ebullient, energetic, and refreshed for the whole day, because certain critical hormones are injected into the bloodstream immediately after REM sleep.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Now, obviously, anyone who is woken by an alarm clock, will sometimes be woken in the middle of delta sleep and will, on those days, have a lethargic day; and will sometimes wake up just after REM sleep and will, on those days, have an energetic day.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Now, the only way to make sure that you wake up at the right time, with the closure of REM sleep, is to wake up naturally.</p>
<p>Summary 6: You can only wake up naturally, and in accordance with the other, larger cycle of metabolic activity, if you wake up with the sun.</p>
