<p>Summary 1:  Make a special part of the house distinct from the common areas and all the children&#039;s rooms, where the man and woman of the house can be together in private.</p>
<p>Summary 2: When children come, concern for parenthood often overwhelms the private sharing, and everything becomes exclusively oriented toward the children.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Children are able to run everywhere in the house, and therefore tend to dominate all of it.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The bathroom is often placed so that adults must walk past children&#039;s bedrooms to reach it.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The result is that the private life of the couple is continually interrupted by the awareness that the children are nearby.</p>
<p>Summary 6: In many respects it is a version of the pattern HOUSE FOR A COUPLE, embedded in the larger house with children..</p>
