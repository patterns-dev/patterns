<p>Summary 1:  If you are designing a building from scratch, these larger patterns have already helped you to decide how high your buildings are; and they have given you a rough layout, in wings, with an idea of what spaces there are going to be in each floor of the wings.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Few buildings will be structurally and socially intact, unless the floors step down toward the ends of wings, and unless the roof, accordingly, forms a cascade.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Visualize the whole building, or building complex, as a system of roofs.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Place the largest, highest, and widest roofs over those parts of the building which are most significant: when you come to lay the roofs out in detail, you will be able to make all lesser roofs cascade off these large roofs and form a stable self-buttressing system, which is congruent with the hierarchy of social spaces underneath the roofs.</p>
<p>Summary 5: If you conceive of the cascade as pyramidal and the building is large, the middle section of the building will be cut off from daylight.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Later, once the plan of the building is more exactly defined, you can lay out the roofs exactly to fit the cascade to individual rooms; and at that stage the cascade will begin to have a structural effect of great importance - STRUCTURE FOLLOWS SOCIAL SPACES, ROOF LAYOUT..</p>
