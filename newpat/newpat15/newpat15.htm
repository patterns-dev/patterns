<p>Summary 1:  Encourage the formation of a boundary around each neighborhood, to separate it from the next door neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Of course, the few neighborhood shops there are - the STREET CAFE, the CORNER GROCERY - will help to form the edge of the neighborhood, but by and large the boundary of neighborhoods will have to come from a completely different morphological principle.</p>
<p>Summary 3: From observations of neighborhoods that succeed in being well defined, both physically and in the minds of the townspeople, we have learned that the single most important feature of a neighborhood&#039;s boundary is restricted access into the neighborhood: neighborhoods that are successfully defined have definite and relatively few paths and roads leading into them.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The result is that people do not come into the neighborhood by car unless they have business there; and when people are in the neighborhood, they recognize that they are in a distinct part of town.</p>
<p>Summary 5: If each neighborhood is a self-contained entity, then the community of 7000 which the neighborhoods belong to will not control any of the land internal to the neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Summary 6: The easiest way of all to form a boundary around a neighborhood is by turning buildings inward, and by cutting off the paths which cross the boundary, except for one or two at special points which become gateways MAIN GATEWAYS; the public land of the boundary may include a park, collector roads, small parking lots, and work communities anything which forms a natural edge PARALLEL ROADS, WORK COMMUNITY, QUlET BACKS, ACCESSIBLE GREEN, SHIELDED PARKING, SMALL PARKING LOTS..</p>
