<p>Summary 1:  In some fashion, low ceilings make for intimacy, high ceilings for formality.</p>
<p>Summary 2: On the basis of this effect, it is clear that intimate situations require very low ceilings, less intimate situations require higher ceilings, formal places require high ceilings, and the most public situations require the highest ceilings: for example, the canopy over the double bed, a fireside nook, high-ceilinged formal reception room, Grand Central Station.</p>
<p>Summary 3: For if a building contains rooms with several different ceiling heights in it and the height has an effect on social relationships, then the mere fact that the ceiling heights vary, allows people to move from high rooms to low rooms, and vice versa, according to the degree of intimacy they seek - because they know that everyone correlates intimacy with ceiling height.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Build storage between floors and ceilings - at least two feet deep - where you want to lower ceiling heights.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Except in one-story buildings, the low ceilinged rooms will make most sense on upper stories; indeed, the average ceiling height will probably get lower and lower with successive stories - the most public rooms, for the largest gatherings, are typically on the ground, and rooms get progressively more intimatc the further they are from the ground.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Get the shape of individual rooms under any given ceiling height from THE SHAPE OF INDOOR SPACE and STRUCTURE FOLLOWS SOCIAL SPACES; and vary ceiling heights from story to story - the highest ceilings on the ground floor and the lowest on the top floor - see the table in FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION..</p>
