<p>Summary 1:  Most housing is in residential neighborhoods, and in the clusters within neighborhoods IDENTIFlABLE NEIGHBORHOOD, HOUSE CLUSTER; and according to our patterns these housing areas need to be separated by boundaries which contain public land and work communities - SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, NEIGHBORHOOD BOUNDARY, WORK COMMUNITY.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Even these work communities, and boundaries, and shopping streets, must contain houses which have people living in them.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Build houses into the fabric of shops, small industry, schools, public services, universities all those parts of cities which draw people in during the day, but which tend to be &quot;Nonresidential&quot;.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The houses may be in rows or &quot;Hills&quot; with shops beneath, or they may be free-standing, so long as they mix with the other functions, and make the entire area &quot;Lived-in.&quot; When people have their own homes among shops, workplaces, schools, services, the university, these places are enhanced by the vitality that is natural to their homes.</p>
<p>Summary 5: It is only where houses are mixed in between the other functions, in twos and threes, in rows and tiny clusters, that the personal quality of the households and house-building activities gives energy to the workshops and offices and services.</p>
<p>Summary 6: If there are several houses in one area, treat them as a cluster or as a row - HOUSE CLUSTER, ROW HOUSES.....</p>
