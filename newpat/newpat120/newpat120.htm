<p>Summary 1:  The layout of paths will seem right and comfortable only when it is compatible with the process of walking.</p>
<p>Summary 2: The paths may be straight, or gently curving between goals; their paving should swell around the goal.</p>
<p>Summary 3: As you walk along you scan the landscape for intermediate destinations - the furthest points along the path which you can see.</p>
<p>Summary 4: 3- Since you do not want to keep changing direction while you walk and do not want to spend your whole time re-calculating your best direction of travel, you arrange your walking process in such a way that you pick a temporary &quot;Goal&quot; - some clearly visible landmark - which is more or less in the direction you want to take and then walk in a straight line toward it for a hundred yards as you get close, pick another new goal, once more a hundred yards further on, and walk toward it....</p>
<p>Summary 5: In the diagram above a person begins at A and heads for point E.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Along the way, his intermediate goals are points B, C, and D.</p>
