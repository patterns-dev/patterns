<p>Summary 1:  In a traditional society, one learns to live with the people he knows, but the people he knows form a relatively closed group; there is little possibility of expanding it greatly.</p>
<p>Summary 2: In theory, a man in a city of five million people has the possibility of meeting just those half dozen people who are the people he most wants to be with, in all of these five million.</p>
<p>Summary 3: On the contrary, people complain constantly that they cannot meet enough people, that there are too few opportunities for meeting people.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Far from being free to explore the natures of all the people in society, and free to be together with those others who have the greatest natural and mutual affinities, instead people feel constrained to be with the few people they happen to have run into.</p>
<p>Summary 5: If these three hypotheses are correct, as we believe, then it is plain that the process by which people meet one another depends very largely on the extent to which people are able to pass from group to group, as visitors and guests, at communal meals.</p>
<p>Summary 6: If the institution is large, find some way of breaking it down into smaller groups which eat together, so that no one group which eats together has more than about a dozen people in it - SMALL WORK GROUPS, SMALL MEETING ROOMS..</p>
