<p>Summary 1:  Under the impetus of PARALLEL ROADS and NETWORK OF PATHS AND CARS, paths will gradually grow at right angles to major roads - not along them as they do now.</p>
<p>Summary 2: At any point where a pedestrian path crosses a road that has enough traffic to create more than a two second delay to people crossing, make a &quot;Knuckle&quot; at the crossing: narrow the road to the width of the through lanes only; continue the pedestrian path through the crossing about a foot above the roadway; put in islands between lanes; slope the road up toward the crossing; mark the path with a canopy or shelter to make it visible.</p>
<p>Summary 3: The people who cross a road will only feel comfortable and safe if the road crossing is a physical obstruction, which physically guarantees that the cars must slow down and give way to pedestrians.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The same principle applies, even more powerfully, where pedestrians have to cross a road.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The pedestrians who cross must be extremely visible from the road.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Cars should also be forced to slow down when they approach the crossing.</p>
