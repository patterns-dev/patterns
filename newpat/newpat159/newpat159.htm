<p>Summary 1:  Locate each room so that it has outdoor space outside it on at least two sides, and then place windows in these outdoor walls so that natural light falls into every room from more than one direction.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Were people in fact avoiding rooms lit only on one side, preferring the two-sided rooms - what did they think about it?.</p>
<p>Summary 3: In a room lit on only one side, the light gradient on the walls and floors inside the room is very steep, so that the part furthest from the window is uncomfortably dark, compared with the part near the window.</p>
<p>Summary 4: In a small building, it is easy to give every room light on two sides: one room in each of the four corners of a house does it automatically.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Finally, if a room simply has to be more than eight feet deep, but cannot have light from two sides - then the problem can be solved by making the ceiling very high, by painting the walls very white, and by putting great high windows in the wall, set into very deep reveals, deep enough to offset the glare.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Place the individual windows to look onto something beautiful -WINDOWS OVERLOOKING LIFE, NATURAL DOORS AND WINDOWS; and make one of the windows in the room a special one, so that a place gathers itself around it - WINDOW PLACE..</p>
