<p>Summary 1:  How should we make the most of a view? It turns out that the pattern which answers this question helps to govern not the rooms and windows in a building, but the places of transition.</p>
<p>Summary 2: If there is a beautiful view, don&#039;t spoil it by building huge windows that gape incessantly at it.</p>
<p>Summary 3: If the view window is correctly placed, people will see a glimpse of the distant view as they come up to the window or pass it: but the view is never visible from the places where people stay.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Even for the man who lives there, coming past that view day after day for fifty years, it will still be alive.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Put in the windows to complete the indirectness of the view - NATURAL DOORS AND WINDOWS place them to help the TAPESTRY OF LIGHT AND DARK and build a seat from which a person can enjoy the view - WINDOW PLACE.</p>
<p>Summary 6: If the view must be visible from inside a room, make a special corner of the room which looks onto the view, so that the enjoyment of the view becomes a definite act in its own right.....</p>
