<p>Summary 1:  Where fast moving cars and pedestrians meet in cities, the cars overwhelm the pedestrians.</p>
<p>Summary 2: On an ordinary street, cars make pedestrians feel small and vulnerable because the sidewalks are too narrow and too low.</p>
<p>Summary 3: When the car is down low and the pedestrian world physically higher, pedestrians feel, symbolically, that they are more important than the cars and therefore feel secure.</p>
<p>Summary 4: For the pedestrian to feel certain that a car could not climb the curb, the curb height would have to be greater than the radius of a car tire.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Although tall people can see over cars, even for them, the cars fill the landscape since a standing person&#039;s normal line of sight is 10 degrees below the horizontal.</p>
<p>Summary 6: To put a car 12 feet away completely below a pedestrian&#039;s line of sight, it would have to be on a road some 18 to 30 inches below the pedestrian..</p>
