<p>Summary 1:  Include a volume for bulk storage in the building - its floor area at least 15 to 20 per cent of the whole building area - not less.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Some old buildings provide for this kind of storage automatically, with their attics, cellars, and sheds.</p>
<p>Summary 3: In our experience bulk storage space is terribly important; and when it is not provided, it usually means that some other space becomes the receptacle for all the bulky, marginal things that people need to store.</p>
<p>Summary 4: How much bulk storage should be provided? Certainly there should not be too much of it.</p>
<p>Summary 5: In the extreme case, it is even necessary to have space for storing building materials! The amount needed is never less than 10 per cent of the built area - sometimes as high as 50 per cent - and normally 15 to 20 per cent.</p>
<p>Summary 6: No matter whether it is an attic, cellar, or shed, it is usually good advice to follow NORTH FACE and situate bulk storage to the north of the building, leaving the sunny, spaces for rooms and gardens.....</p>
