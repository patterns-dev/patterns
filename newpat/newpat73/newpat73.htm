<p>Summary 1:  Inside the local neighborhood, even if there is common land where children can meet and play - COMMON LAND, CONNECTED PLAY; it is essential that there be at least one smaller part, which is differentiated, where the play is wilder, and where the children have access to all kinds of junk.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Set up a playground for the children in each neighborhood.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Not a highly finished playground, with asphalt and swings, but a place with raw materials of all kinds - nets, boxes, barrels, trees, ropes, simple tools, frames, grass, and water - where children can create and re-create playgrounds of their own.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Play has many functions: it gives children a chance to be together, a chance to use their bodies, to build muscles, and to test new skills.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Children come to terms with the world, wrestle with their pictures of it, and reform these pictures constantly, through those adventures of imagination we call play.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Any kind of playground which disturbs, or reduces, the role of imagination and makes the child more passive, more the recipient of someone else&#039;s imagination, may look nice, may be clean, may be safe, may be healthy - but it just cannot satisfy the fundamental need which play is all about..</p>
