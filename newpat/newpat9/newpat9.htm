<p>Summary 1:  Children grow up in areas where there are no men, except on weekends; women are trapped in an atmosphere where they are expected to be pretty, unintelligent housekeepers; men are forced to accept a schism in which they spend the greater part of their waking lives &quot;At work, and away from their families&quot; and then the other part of their lives &quot;With their families, away from work.</p>
<p>Summary 2: In order to overcome this schism and re-establish the connection between love and work, central to a sane society, there needs to be a redistribution of all workplaces throughout the areas where people live, in such a way that children are near both men and women during the day, women are able to see themselves both as loving mothers and wives and still capable of creative work, and men too are able to experience the hourly connection of their lives as workmen and their lives as loving husbands and fathers.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Workers can go home casually for lunch, run errands, work half-time, and spend half the day at home.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Some workplaces are in homes; there are many opportunities for people to work from their homes or to take work home.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The only pattern of work which does justice to these requirements is a pattern of scattered work: a pattern in which work is strongly decentralized.</p>
<p>Summary 6: To understand these facts, we must first realize that the city itself is a vast centralized workspace and that all the benefits of this centralization are potentially available to every work group that is a part of the city&#039;s vast work community..</p>
