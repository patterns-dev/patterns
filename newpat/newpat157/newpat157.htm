<p><i>Summaries of content, keywords and links generated by algorithms. Thank you <a href="http://smmry.com/" target="_blank">smmry.com</a>:</i></p>
<p>Summary 1:  As the decentralization of work becomes more and more effective, the workshop in the home grows and grows in importance.</p>
<p>Summary 2: We have explained in SCATTERED WORK, NETWORK OF LEARNING, MEN AND WOMEN, SELF-GOVERNING WORKSHOPS AND OFFICES, and other patterns that we imagine a society in which work and family are far more intermingled than today; a society in which people - businessmen artists, craftsmen, shopkeepers, professionals - work for themselves, alone and in small groups, with much more relation to their immediate surroundings than they have today.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Even where the public relationship is slight, there is something to be gained, both for the worker and the community, by enlarging the connection between the two.</p>
<p>Summary 4: In the case of the home workshop, the public nature of the work is especially valuable.</p>
<p>Summary 5: According to the nature of the work, the public connection takes the form of a shopfront, a driveway for loading and unloading materials, a work bench in the open, a small meeting room ....</p>
<p>Summary 6: Give the workshop a corner where it is especially nice to work - LIGHT ON TWO SIDES, WORKSPACE ENCLOSURE; a strong connection to the street - OPENING TO THE STREET, WINDOWS OVERLOOKING LIFE; perhaps a place to work in the sun on warm days - SUNNY PLACE..</p>
