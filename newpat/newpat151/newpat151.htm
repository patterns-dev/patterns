<p>Summary 1:  Make at least 70 per cent of all meeting rooms really small - for 12 people or less.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Most of these meetings are held in rooms designed for far more than 15 people.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Finally, the spatial distribution of meeting rooms is often as poorly adapted to the actual meetings as the size distribution.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The meeting rooms are not located where people work.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The meetings work best when the meeting rooms are fairly near the participants&#039; offices.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Shape meeting rooms like any other rooms, perhaps with special emphasis on the fact that there must be no glare - LIGHT ON TWO SIDES OF EVERY ROOM - and on the fact that the rooms should be roughly round or square, and not too long or narrow - SITTING CIRCLE..</p>
