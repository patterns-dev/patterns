<p>Summary 2: In badly planned kitchens, the shelves are filled with things three or four items deep, sometimes stacked on top of each other, and something is always in the way of what you need.</p>
<p>Summary 3: In wellplanned kitchens, all storage is one item deep.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Shelves are one can deep, glasses arc stored one row deep, pots and pans are hung one deep on the wall; for small jars and spices there are special spice shelves that hold the items just one deep.</p>
