<p>Summary 1:  Replace the &quot;High school&quot; with an institution which is actually a model of adult society, in which the students take on most of the responsibility for learning and social life, with clearly defined roles and forms of discipline.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Provide adult guidance, both for the learning, and the social structure of the society; but keep them as far as feasible, in the hands of the students.</p>
<p>Summary 3: There is no new form of society, which is a microcosm of adult society, where they can test their growing adulthood in any serious way.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Years of age, and that teenagers be given many options for participation in society; that the size of high schoo!s be reduced drastically, so that they are not so much a world apart from society; that each city provide opportunities for its young to work as apprentices in the local businesses and services, - and that such work be considered part of one&#039;s formal learning.</p>
<p>Summary 5: More specifically, we believe that the teenagers in a town, boys and girls from the ages of about 12 to 18, should be encouraged to form a miniature society, in which they are as differentiated, and as responsible mutually, as the adults in the full-scale adult society.</p>
<p>Summary 6: It is necessary, in short, that their society is a microcosm of adult society, not an artificial society where people play at being adult, but the real thing, with real rewards, real tragedies, real work, real love, real friendship, real achievements, real responsibility..</p>
