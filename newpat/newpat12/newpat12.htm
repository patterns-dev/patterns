<p>Summary 1:  Community of 7000 helps define the structure of the large communities.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Individuals have no effective voice in any community of more than 5000-10,000 persons.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Decentralize city governments in a way that gives local control to communities of 5,000 to 10,000 persons.</p>
<p>Summary 4: People can only have a genuine effect on local government when the units of local government are autonomous, self-governing, self-budgeting communities, which are small enough to create the possibility of an immediate link between the man in the street and his local officials and elected representatives.</p>
<p>Summary 5: At 25 persons per acre, such a community would accommodate some 2000 persons; at 60 persons per acre, some 4500.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Separate the communities from one another by means of substantial areas - SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY; subdivide each community into 10 or 20 independent neighborhoods, each with a representative on the community council IDENTIFlABLE NEiGHBORHOOD; provide a central place where people have a chance to come together - ECCENTRIC NUCLEUS, PROMENADE; and in this central place provide a local town hall, as a focal point for the community&#039;s political activity - LOCAL TOWN HALL.....</p>
