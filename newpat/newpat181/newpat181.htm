<p>Summary 1:  Adjust the location until it knits together the social spaces and rooms around it, giving them each a glimpse of the fire; and make a window or some other focus to sustain the place during the times when the fire is out.</p>
<p>Summary 2: The most convincing statement of the need for fire that we have found is in Gaston Bachelard&#039;s book, The Psychoanalysis of Fire.</p>
<p>Summary 3: The fire confined to the fireplace was no doubt for man the first object of reverie, the symbol of repose, the invitation to repose.</p>
<p>Summary 4: One can hardly conceive of a philosophy of repose that would not include a reverie before a flaming log fire.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Of course the supporters of the theory of the utilitarian formation of the mind will not accept a theory so facile in its idealism, and they will point out to us the multiple uses of fire in order to ascertain the exact interest that we have in it: not only does fire give heat, but it also cooks meats.</p>
<p>Summary 6: The lesson taught by the fire is clear: &quot;&#039;After having gained all through skill, through love or through violence you must give up all, you must annihilate yourself..</p>
