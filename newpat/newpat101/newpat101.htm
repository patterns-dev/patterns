<p>Summary 1:  If the building complex is built at high density, then at least part of the circulation cannot be made of outdoor PEDESTRIAN STREETS because the buildings cover too much of the land; in this case, the main spines of the CIRCULATION REALMS must take the form of building thoroughfares similar to pedestrian streets, but partly or wholly inside the buildings.</p>
<p>Summary 2: When a public building complex cannot be completely served by outdoor pedestrian streets, a new form of indoor street, quite different from the conventional corridor, is needed.</p>
<p>Summary 3: When a building complex is so tightly packed on the site that there is no reasonable space for outdoor streets because the entire building complex is a continuous two, three, or four story building, it becomes necessary to think of major thoroughfares in different terms.</p>
<p>Summary 4: People hardly ever feel free to linger in public corridors when they are off the street.</p>
<p>Summary 5: In order to solve these new problems, created when we try to put a street indoors, the indoor streets - or building thoroughfares - need five specific characteristics.</p>
<p>Summary 6: As far as possible, the indoor street should be a continuation of the circulation outside the building..</p>
