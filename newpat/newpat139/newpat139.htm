<p>Summary 1:  The isolated kitchen, separate from the family and considered as an efficient but unpleasant factory for food is a hangover from the days of servants; and from the more recent days when women willingly took over the servants&#039; role.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Make the kitchen bigger than usual, big enough to include the &quot;Family room&quot; space, and place it near the center of the commons, not so far back in the house as an ordinary kitchen.</p>
<p>Summary 3: In traditional societies, where there were no servants and the members of a family took care of their own food, the isolated kitchen was virtually unknown.</p>
<p>Summary 4: When the servants disappeared, the kitchen was still left separate, because it was thought &quot;Genteel&quot; and &quot;Nice&quot; to eat in dining rooms away from any sight or smell of food.</p>
<p>Summary 5: In the farmhouse kitchen, kitchen work and family activity were completely integrated in one big room.</p>
<p>Summary 6: When you place the kitchen counters later, make them really long and generous and toward the south to get the light - COOKING LAYOUT, SUNNY COUNTER; leave room for an alcove or two around the kitchen - ALCOVES; make the table in the middle big, and hang a nice big warm single light right in the middle to draw the family around it - EATING ATMOSPHERE; surround the walls, when you detail them, with plenty of open shelves for pots, and mugs, and bottles, and jars of jam - OPEN SHELVES, WAIST-HIGH SHELF..</p>
