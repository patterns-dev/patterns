<p>Summary 1:  The main function of a building&#039;s outside wall is to keep weather out.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Build up the exterior wall surface with materials that are lapped against the weather: either &quot;Internally lapped,&quot; like exterior plaster, or more literally lapped, like shingles and boards and tiles.</p>
<p>Summary 3: In either case, choose a material that is easy to repair in little patches, inexpensively, so that little by little, the wall can be maintained in good condition indefinitely.</p>
<p>Summary 4: All of these walls are made of many small elements, so that individual pieces can be replaced as they are damaged or wear out.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Bear in mind then, as you choose an exterior wall finish, that it should be a material which can be easily lapped against the weather, which is made of elements that are easy to repair locally, and which therefore can be maintained piecemeal, indefinitely.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Slate, corrugated iron, ceramic tiles will produce excellent shingled wall claddings, and can all be placed in such a way as to provide exterior formwork for the pouring of a wall..</p>
