<p>Summary 1:  In each room, place the windows in such a way that their total area conforms roughly to the appropriate figures for your region, and place them in positions which give the best possible views out over life: activities in streets, quiet gardens, anything different from the indoor scene.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Thomas Markus presents evidence which shows clearly that office workers prefer windows with meaningful views - views of city life, nature - as against views which also take in large areas, but contain uninteresting and less meaningful elements.</p>
<p>Summary 3: We now give very rough figures for the total area of the windows in a room.</p>
<p>Summary 4: In each case, measure the window area as a percentage of the floor area; then take the average of the different percentages.</p>
<p>Summary 5: In our part of the world - Berkeley, California - we find that rooms are most pleasant when they have about 25 per cent window - sometimes as much as 50 per cent -.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Fine tune the exact positions of the windows at the time that you build them - NATURAL DOORS AND WINDOWS; break the area of each window into SMALL PANES; give each window a very LOW SILL to improve the view and DEEP REVEALS to make the light as soft as possible inside.....</p>
