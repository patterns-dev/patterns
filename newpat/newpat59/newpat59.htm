<p>Summary 1:  Give the buildings in the busy parts of town a quiet &quot;Back&quot; behind them and away from the noise.</p>
<p>Summary 2: The walk along the Seine, through the middle of Paris, is a classic &quot;Quiet back&quot; in the middle of a fast city.</p>
<p>Summary 3: A beautiful case is the University of Cambridge: each college has its &quot;Backs&quot; - quiet courts stretching down to the River Cam.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The need for quiet backs goes far beyond the university.</p>
<p>Summary 5: If the front is given over to the street life, cars, shopping paths, delivery - then the back can be reserved for quiet.</p>
