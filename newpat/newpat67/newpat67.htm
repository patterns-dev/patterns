<p>Summary 1:  Just as there is a need for public land at the neighborhood level - ACCESSIBLE GREEN, so also, within the clusters and work communities from which the neighborhoods are made, there is a need for smaller and more private kinds of common land shared by a few work groups or a few families.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Give over 25 per cent of the land in house clusters to common land which touches, or is very very near, the homes which share it.</p>
<p>Summary 3: In pre-industrial societies, common land between houses and between workshops existed automatically - so it was never necessary to make a point of it.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Common land provides a meeting ground for the fluid, common activities that a house cluster shares.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Enough land must be common so that private land doesn&#039;t dominate it psychologically.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Shape the common land so it has some enclosure and good sunlight - SOUTH FACING OUTDOORS, POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE; and so that smaller and more private pieces of land and pockets always open onto it -HIERARCHY OF OPEN SPACE; provide communal functions within the land - PUBLIC OUTDOOR ROOM, LOCAL SPORTS, VEGETABLE GARDEN; and connect the different and adjacent pieces of common land to one another to form swaths of connected play space - CONNECTED PLAY..</p>
