<p>Summary 1:  Just as an individual person dreams fantastic happenings to release the inner forces which cannot be encompassed by ordinary events, so too a city needs its dreams.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Set aside some part of the town as a carnival - mad side-shows, tournaments, acts, displays, competitions, dancing, music, street theater, clowns, transvestites, freak events, which allow people to reveal their madness; weave a wide pedestrian street through this area; run booths along the street, narrow alleys; at one end an outdoor theater; perhaps connect the theater stage directly to the carnival street, so the two spill into and feed one another.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Man has a great need for mad, subconscious processes to come into play, without unleashing them to such an extent that they become socially destructive.</p>
<p>Summary 4: In Western civilization during the last three or four hundred years, the closest available source of this outward acknowledgment of underground life has been the circus, fairs, and carnivals.</p>
<p>Summary 5: We imagine something more along the following lines: street theater, clowns, mad games in the streets and squares and houses; during certain weeks, people may live in the carnival; simple food and shelter are free; day and night people mixing; actors who mingle with the crowd and involve you, willy nilly, in processes whose end cannot be foreseen; fighting -two men with bags on a slippery log, in front of hundreds; Fellini-clowns, death, crazy people, brought into mesh.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Remember the hunchbacked dwarf in Ship of Fools, the only reasonable person on the ship, who says &quot;Everyone has a problem; but I have the good fortune to wear mine on my back, where everyone can see it.&quot; Dancing in the street, food stands, an outdoor room or two, a square where the theater is, and tents and canvas will all help to make it even livelier - SMALL PUBLIC SQUARES, DANCING IN THE STREET, PUBLIC OUTDOOR ROOM, FOOD STANDS, PEDESTRIAN STREET, CANVAS ROOFS .....</p>
