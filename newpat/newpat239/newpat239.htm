<p>Summary 1:  The smaller the windows are, and the smaller the panes are, the more intensely windows help connect us with what is on the other side.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Our contact with the view, our contact with the things we see through windows is affected by the way the window frames them.</p>
<p>Summary 3: When we consider a window as an eye through which to see a view, we must recognize that it is the extent to which the window frames the view, that increases the view, increases its intensity, increases its variety, even increases the number of views we seem to see - and it is because of this that windows which are broken into smaller windows, and windows which are filled with tiny panes, put us so intimately in touch with what is on the other side.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Thomas Markus, who has studied windows extensively, has arrived at the same conclusion: windows which are broken up make for more interesting views.</p>
<p>Summary 5: He points out that small and narrow windows afford different views from different positions in the room, while the view tends to be the same through large windows or horizontal ones.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Another argument for small panes: Modern architecture and building have deliberately tried to make windows less like windows and more as though there was nothing between you and the outdoors..</p>
