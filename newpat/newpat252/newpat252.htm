<p>Summary 1:  Place the lights low, and apart, to form individual pools of light which encompass chairs and tables like bubbles to reinforce the social character of the spaces which they form.</p>
<p>Summary 2: When the light is perfectly even, the social function of the space gets utterly destroyed: it even becomes difficult for people to form natural human groups.</p>
<p>Summary 3: If a group is in an area of uniform illumination, there are no light gradients corresponding to the boundary of the group, so the definition, cohesiveness, and &quot;Existence&quot; of the group will be weakened.</p>
<p>Summary 4: These authors conclude that local lighting over a work table allows the worker to pay more attention to his work than uniform background lighting does.</p>
<p>Summary 5: We know of many failures: for example, places where small lights do break down even illumination, but do not correspond in any real way with the places where people tend to gather in the space.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Color the lampshades and the hangings near the lights to make the light which bounces off them warm in color - WARM COLORS.....</p>
