<p>Summary 1:  At various places in the building, there are walls between rooms where windows would help the rooms to be more alive by creating more views of people and by letting extra light into the darkest corners.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Put in fully glazed fixed windows between rooms which tend to be dead because they have too little action in them or where inside rooms are unusually dark.</p>
<p>Summary 3: People feel more connected to one another by interior windows, and the passages in the building become less deserted.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The same may hold for certain rooms, especially small rooms.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Windows placed between rooms, or between a passage and a room, will help to solve these problems and will make both the passages and the rooms more lively.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Make the windows the same as any other windows, with small panes of glass - SMALL PANES..</p>
