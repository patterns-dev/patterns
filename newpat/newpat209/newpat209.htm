<p>Summary 1:  Arrange the roofs so that each distinct roof corresponds to an identifiable social entity in the building or building complex.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Place the largest roofs - those which are highest and have the largest span - over the largest and most important and most communal spaces; build the lesser roofs off these largest and highest roofs; and build the smallest roofs of all off these lesser roofs, in the form of half-vaults and sheds over alcoves and thick walls.</p>
<p>Summary 3: From SHELTERING ROOF, that entire wings should be under one roof whenever possible and that the building is to be roofed with a mixture of flat roofs and sloping or domical roofs, with the accent on those which are not flat.</p>
<p>Summary 4: We may therefore state the problem of defining a roof layout as follows: Given an arbitrary plan of the type described above, how can we fit to it an arrangement of roofs which conforms to the CASCADE OF ROOFS and SHELTERING ROOF and ROOF GARDENS?.</p>
<p>Summary 5: When you have finished, the overall arrangement of the roofs should form a self-buttressing cascade in which each lower roof helps to take up the horizonal thrust generated by the higher roofs-and the overall section of the roofs, taken in very very general terms, tends toward a rough upside down catenary.</p>
<p>Summary 6: You can build all these roofs, and the connections between them, by following the instructions for roof vaults - ROOF VAULTS..</p>
