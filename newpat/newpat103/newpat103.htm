<p>Summary 1:  Since a small parking lot is a kind of gateway - the place - where you leave your car, and enter a pedestrian realm - this pattern helps to complete SHOPPING STREETS, HOUSE CLUSTER, WORK COMMUNITY, GREEN STREETS, MAIN GATEWAYS, CIRCULATION REALMS, and any other areas which need small and convenient amounts of parking.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Make parking lots small, serving no more than five to seven cars, each lot surrounded by garden walls, hedges, fences, slopes, and trees, so that from outside the cars are almost invisible.</p>
<p>Summary 3: In NINE PER CENT PARKING, we have suggested that the fabric of society is threatened by the mere existence of cars, if areas for parked cars take up more than 9 or 10 per cent of the land in a community.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Large parking lots, suited for the cars, have all the wrong properties for people.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Our observations suggest that parking lots for four cars are still essentially pedestrian and human in character; that lots for six cars are acceptable; but that any area near a parking lot which holds eight cars is already clearly identifiable as &quot;Car dominated territory&quot;.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Shield even these quite modest parking lots with garden walls, and trees, and fences, so that they help to generate the space around them - POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE, TREE PLACES, GARDEN WALLS.....</p>
