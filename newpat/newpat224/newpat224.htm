<p>Summary 1:  Some of the doors in a building play a special role in creating transitions and maintaining privacy: it may be any of the doors governed by FAMILY OF ENTRANCES, or MAIN ENTRANCE, or THE FLOW THROUGH ROOMS or CORNER DOORS, or NATURAL DOORS AND WINDOWS.</p>
<p>Summary 2: &quot;The 6&#039; 8&quot; rectangular door is such a standard pattern, and is so taken for granted, that it is hard to imagine how strongly it dominates the experience of transition.</p>
<p>Summary 3: There have been times when people were more sensitive to the moment of passage, and made the shape of their doors convey the feeling of transition.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Test the height before you build it, in place - NATURAL DOORS AND WINDOWS.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Build the door frame as part of the structure - FRAMES AS THICKENED EDGES, and make it beautiful with ORNAMENT around the frame.</p>
<p>Summary 6: If there is a door, glaze it, at least partially - SOLID DOORS WITH GLASS..</p>
