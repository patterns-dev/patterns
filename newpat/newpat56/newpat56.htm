<p>Summary 1:  Bikes on roads are threatened by cars; bikes on paths threaten pedestrians.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Build a system of paths designated as bike paths, with the following properties: the bike paths are marked clearly with a special, easily recognizable surface.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Where a bike path runs along a local road, its surface may be, level with the road - if possible, on the sunny side; where a bike path runs along a pedestrian path, keep it separate from that path and a few inches below it.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Bikes endanger pedestrians along pedestrian paths; yet people often tend to ride bikes along pedestrian paths, not roads, because they are the shortest routes.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Where bike paths run alongside local roads, parking should be removed from that side of the road; the bike surface may simply be part of the road and level with it.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Build the racks for bikes to one side of the main entrance, so that the bikes don&#039;t interfere with people&#039;s natural movement in and out - MAIN ENTRANCE, and give it some shelter, with the path from the racks to the entrance also under shelter - ARCADES ; keep the bikes out of quiet walks and quiet gardens - QUIET BACKS, GARDEN WALL .....</p>
