<p>Summary 1:  There is another way of being outdoors: and its needs are not met by the garden at all.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Build a place outdoors which has so much enclosure round it, that it takes on the feeling of a room, even though it is open to the sky.</p>
<p>Summary 3: They need an outdoor room, a literal outdoor room - a partly enclosed space, outdoors, but enough like a room so that people behave there as they do in rooms, but with the added beauties of the sun, and wind, and smells, and rustling leaves, and crickets.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Even the &quot;Picture window,&quot; as the domestic version of the show-window is called, has contributed to the estrangement between indoors and outdoors; the garden has become a spectator garden.</p>
<p>Summary 5: An outdoor space becomes a special outdoor room when it is well enclosed with walls of the building, walls of foliage, columns, trellis, and sky; and when the outdoor room, together with an indoor space, forms a virtually continuous living area.</p>
<p>Summary 6: An OUTDOOR ROOM has walls around it and is only partially roofed; while a PUBLIC OUTDOOR ROOM has a roof, but essentially no walls..</p>
