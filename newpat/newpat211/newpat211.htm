<p>Summary 1:  We have established in THICK WALLS, how important it is for the walls of a building to have &quot;Depth&quot; and &quot;Volume,&quot; so that character accumulates, in them, with time.</p>
<p>Summary 2: The walls will not usually be thick in the literal sense, except in certain special cases where mud construction, for example, lends itself to the making of walls.</p>
<p>Summary 3: If the framework of a wall is made of columns standing away from the back face of the wall, then the wall invites modification - it becomes natural and easy to nail planks to the columns, and so make seats, and shelves, and changes there.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Theoretically, a person can always add things which stick out from the wall, the very smoothness of the wall makes it much less likely to happen.</p>
<p>Summary 5: In order to make an alcove or thick wall work as a buttress, build its roof as near as possible to a continuation of the curve of the floor vault immediately inside.</p>
<p>Summary 6: When you lay out columns and minor colunms, put a column at the corner of every thick wall, so that the wall space, like other social spaces, becomes a recognizable part of the building structure - COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS..</p>
