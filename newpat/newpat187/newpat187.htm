<p>Summary 1:  The bed is the center of a couple&#039;s life together: the place where they lie together, talk, make love, sleep, sleep late, take care of each other during illness.</p>
<p>Summary 2: At the right moment in a couple&#039;s life, it is important that they make for themselves a special bed - an intimate anchor point for their lives; slightly enclosed, with a low ceiling or a canopy, with the room shaped to it; perhaps a tiny room built around the bed with many windows.</p>
<p>Summary 3: There is a low ceiling, or a partial ceiling, over the bed.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Find a way of adding to the bed and the space around it, so that it will become more personal and unique over the years; for example, a headboard that can be carved, painted, repainted, or a cloth ceiling that can be changed, embroidered.</p>
<p>Summary 5: &quot;Strange man, I am not proud, or contemptuous, or offended, but I know what manner of man you were when you sailed away from Ithaca.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Come Eurycleia, make the bed outside the room which he built himself; put the fine bedstead outside, and lay out the rugs and blankets and fleeces.</p>
