<p>Summary 1:  Connect your building up, wherever possible, to the existing buildings round about.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Do not keep set backs between buildings; instead, try to form new buildings as continuations of the older buildings.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Even in medium and high density areas where buildings are very close to each other and where there are strong reasons to connect them in a single fabric, people still insist on building isolated structures, with little bits of useless space around them.</p>
<p>Summary 4: A town of disconnected buildings, in a dream, would be a picture of society, made up of disconnected, isolated, selves.</p>
<p>Summary 5: When buildings are isolated and free standing, it is of course not necessary for the people who own them, use them, and repair them to interact with one another at all.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Not only is it true that connected buildings have these healthy consequences and that isolated buildings have unhealthy ones..</p>
