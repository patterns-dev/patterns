<p>Summary 1:  Placing the main entrance is perhaps the single most important step you take during the evolution of a building plan.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Place the main entrance of the building at a point where it can be seen immediately from the main avenues of approach and give it a bold, visible shape which stands out in front of the building.</p>
<p>Summary 3: When the entrances are placed correctly, the layout of the building unfolds naturally and simply; when the entrances are badly placed, the rest of the building never seems quite right.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The entrance must be placed in such a way that people who approach the bulding see the entrance or some hint of where the entrance is, as soon as they see the building itself.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Locate entrances so that, once the building(s) come into view, the entrance, too, comes into view; and the path toward the entrance is not more than 50 feet along the building.</p>
<p>Summary 6: If possible, make the entrance one of a family of similar entrances, so that they all stand out as visibly as possible within the street or building complex - FAMILY OF ENTRANCES; build that part of the entrance which sticks out, as a room, large enough to be a pleasant, light, and beautiful place - ENTRANCE ROOM and bring the path between the street and this entrance room through a series of transitions of light and level and view - ENTRANCE TRANSITION..</p>
