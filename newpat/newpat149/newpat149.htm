<p>Summary 1:  Place the reception desk so that it is not between the receptionist and the welcoming area, but to one side at an angle - so that she, or he, can get up and walk toward the people who come in, greet them, and then invite them to sit down.</p>
<p>Summary 2: In most institutions the person arriving has to go toward the receptionist; the receptionist remains passive and offers nothing.</p>
<p>Summary 3: To be welcoming the receptionist must initiate the action - come forward and greet the person, offer a chair, food, a seat by the fire, coffee.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The receptionist comes forward from an inner office, invites you to sit down in a com fortable chair at one of these writing desks, and sits down with you while you fill out the hotel register.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The reasons most reception areas fail completely to have this quality, is that the receptionist&#039;s desk forms a barrier, so that the desk and equipment together help to create an institutional atmosphere, quite at odds with the feeling of welcome.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Place the fireplace most carefully, to be a focus - THE FIRE give the receptionist a workspace where she can be comfortable in her own work, and still make visitors feel welcome WORKSPACE ENCLOSURE; give the space LIGHT ON TWO SIDES; perhaps put in an alcove or a window seat for people who are waiting - A PLACE TO WAIT, ALCOVES, WINDOW PLACE..</p>
