<p>Summary 1:  Lastly, when you have taken care of everything, and you start living in the places you have made, you may wonder what kinds of things to pin up on the walls.</p>
<p>Summary 2: It is most beautiful when it comes straight from your life - the things you care for, the things that tell your story.</p>
<p>Summary 3: From the owner&#039;s point of view, it is obvious that the things around you should be the things which mean most to you, which have the power to play a part in the continuous process of selftransformation, which is your life.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Designers play on these anxieties by making total designs, telling people they have no right to move anything, paint the walls, or add a plant, because they are not party to the mysteries of Good Design.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Jung describes the room that was his study, how he filled the stone walls with paintings that he made each day directly on the stones - mandalas, dream images, preoccupations - and he tells us that the room came gradually to be a living thing to him - the outward counterpart to his unconscious.</p>
<p>Summary 6: A hunting glove, a blind man&#039;s cane, the collar of a favorite dog, a panel of pressed flowers from the time when we were children, oval pictures of grandma, a candlestick, the dust from a volcano carefully kept in a bottle, a picture from the news of prison convicts at Attica in charge of the prison, not knowing that they were about to die, an old photo, the wind blowing in the grass and a church steeple in the distance, spiked sea shells with the hum of the sea still in them.253 THINGS FROM YOUR LIFE..</p>
