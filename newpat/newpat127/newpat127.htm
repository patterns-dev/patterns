<p>Summary 1:  In any building - house, office, public building, summer cottage - people need a gradient of settings, which have different degrees of intimacy.</p>
<p>Summary 2: As far as we can tell, a Peruvian house must not, under any circumstances, violate the principle of the intimacy gradient.</p>
<p>Summary 3: The intimacy gradient is unusually crucial in a Peruvian house.</p>
<p>Summary 4: In a house: gate, outdoor porch, entrance, sitting wall, common space and kitchen, private garden, bed alcoves.</p>
<p>Summary 5: In a more formal house, the sequence might begin with something like the Peruvian sala- a parlor or sitting room for guests.</p>
<p>Summary 6: In private houses make the ENTRANCE ROOM the most formal and public place and arrange the most private areas so that each person has a room of his own, where he can retire to be alone - A ROOM OF ONE&#039;S OWN..</p>
