<p>Summary 1:  Do not use the promenade Use the promenade People who live less than 20 minutes away 13 1 People who live more than 20 minutes away 5 18.</p>
<p>Summary 2: The relation between the catch basin of the promenade, and the actual physical paved area of the promenade itself, is extremely critical.</p>
<p>Summary 3: If one-fifth of this population uses the promenade once a week, for an hour between 6 and 10 p.m., then at any given moment between those hours, there are some 100 people on the promenade.</p>
<p>Summary 4: We imagine the pattern of promenades in a city to be just as varied a continuum ranging from small local promenades serving 2000 people to large intense ones serving the entire city - each different in character and density of action.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Finally, what are the characteristics of a successful promenade? Since people come to see people and to be seen, a promenade must have a high density of pedestrians using it.</p>
<p>Summary 6: The promenade is mainly marked by concentrations of activity along its length ACTIVITY NODES; naturally, some of these will be open at night - NIGHT LIFE; and somewhere on the promenade there will be a concentration of shops - SHOPPING STREET..</p>
